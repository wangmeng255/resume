        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>I enjoy using programming to automate tedious, repetitive tasks. Prior to moving to the U.S., I was an Assistant Professor at the National Astronomical Observatories of China, conducting research on positioning algorithms and error analysis. I implemented a Kalman filter algorithm, balanced our system's memory with the real-time requirements and optimized the program in just one month in an environment that lacked debug capability. When I became frustrated with the complicated process of extracting & collecting the required data, I used C# to build RS232 Monitor software to filter the positioning results and liberate my team from round-the-clock monitoring.
        <p>I’ve spent the past couple of years ensuring a smooth transition for my family as we settled into our new home and expanding my web programming skills. I’m fully cleared to work in the U.S. and am looking forward to applying my skills to help an organization achieve its mission. </p>
