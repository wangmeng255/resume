        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>I enjoy using programming to automate tedious, repetitive tasks. Prior to moving to the U.S., I was an Assistant Professor at the National Astronomical Observatories of China, conducting research on positioning algorithms and error analysis. I implemented a Kalman filter algorithm, balanced our system's memory with the real-time requirements and optimized the program in just one month in an environment that lacked debug capability. When I became frustrated with the complicated process of extracting & collecting the required data, I used C# to build RS232 Monitor software to filter the positioning results and liberate my team from round-the-clock monitoring.</p>
        <p>I’ve spent the past couple of years ensuring a smooth transition for my family as we settled into our new home and expanding my web programming skills. I’m fully cleared to work in the U.S. and am looking forward to applying my skills to help an organization achieve its mission. </p>

        <h4 class="first-h4">Software Development</h4>
        <p>I learned satellite communication principle, positioning algorithm, signal processing and read over the previous code from system level to algorithm level in six months (assembly language to C language).</p>
        <p>I was able to improve our positioning results in one month by setting up a Kalman filter algorithm. The matrix calculations in the filter were time-consuming and gobbled up a great deal of memory. I was able to balance our system's memory with the real-time requirements, thereby optimizing the program in just one month.</p>
        <p>Because our Digital Signal Processor did not provide a step-by-step debug capability, I had to carefully set the input & output, as well as verify it within the development environment to ensure a zero error rate before the program was put to use.</p>

        <h4>Receiver Testing</h4>
        <p>Receiver testing can be a tedious, complicated task that requires skilled operations of test equipment so, after undergoing Agilent's Test Equipment & Spirent Simulator training, I developed a program that relieved my team of a great deal of the manual monitoring that had been required, accelerating our testing rate and decreasing the time required to complete our field experiments from three months to one.</p>
        <h4>Positioning Accuracy Research</h4>
        <p>Based on positioning accuracy algorithms research, I established a positioning error ellipsoid geometric model by analysis of the Dilution of Precision matrix to improve the precision of our position accuracy metric.</p>
        <h4>Positioning Algorithm Research</h4>
        <p>Based on research of altitude aiding positioning algorithm used in the receiver, I proposed a Range Altitude Aiding algorithm that breaks the assumption requiring the altitude much smaller than the semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid.</p>
